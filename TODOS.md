# TODOS

Items identified during architecture reviews (2026-03-12).

## P1 — Must Do

### Extract HVAC logic from V2 backend into industry pack format
**What:** The existing V2 backend has hardcoded HVAC logic (117 smart tags, emergency tiers, service taxonomy, urgency rules). This needs to be extracted into the spec's industry pack format.
**Why:** This is the bridge from current state to target architecture for the industry pack layer. Without it, the industry pack concept remains theoretical.
**Effort:** L
**Depends on:** Section 0 (Current State) being finalized, Industry Pack format being stable.
**Source:** CEO review, Section 1A (Bridge Gap).

### Define compliance graph conflict resolution rule
**What:** Define what happens when the compliance graph returns contradictory rules (e.g., one rule requires a disclosure, another forbids it for the same context). Resolution principle (most-restrictive-wins) is now in Section 5; this TODO covers the full rule set.
**Why:** Without a conflict resolution strategy, the policy gate could silently apply the wrong rule or block everything. Promoted from P2: the policy gate depends on this to function correctly.
**Implementation consideration:** Cross-graph queries ("which compliance rules contradict each other?") require scanning all compliance graph nodes. With markdown/YAML files this is a full-text scan — consider whether the compliance graph specifically should be database-backed (Supabase table with typed relationships) rather than file-based, to enable indexed conflict detection. The rest of the Knowledge Substrate can remain file-based; compliance rules are the highest-stakes query surface.
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Policy Gate detail (Section 5) being finalized.
**Source:** CEO review, Section 2 (Error & Rescue Map). Promoted by eng review.

## P2 — Should Do

### Define external service resilience patterns
**What:** Define fallback behavior when Retell AI, Supabase, Cal.com, or Twilio are unavailable.
**Why:** All four are production SPOFs with no fallback story in the spec.
**Effort:** M
**Depends on:** Section 0 (Current State) establishing which services are critical.
**Source:** CEO review, Section 1F (Single Points of Failure).

### Define Inngest event validation schema
**What:** Define the event schema for harness trigger events emitted by Express V2 after processing Retell webhooks. Include required fields (call_id, tenant_id, call metadata), validation rules, and rejection behavior for malformed events.
**Why:** Without event validation, malformed or unauthorized events could trigger unintended worker execution. This is also a security vector (unauthorized event injection into the Inngest event bus).
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Harness trigger mechanism (Section 5) being implemented, Express V2 webhook handler structure.
**Source:** CEO review #2, Section 3 (Security & Threat Model).

### Define harness → Supabase write failure handling
**What:** Define the specific mechanism for handling Supabase write failures during harness operations: transaction boundaries, retry policy, cleanup on partial failure.
**Why:** Error Philosophy rule #4 says "partial state is the enemy" but there's no specific mechanism for the harness → Supabase integration. A failed write mid-job could leave orphaned artifacts or incomplete tenant state.
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Return path definition (Section 5), Implementation Phasing (Section 24).
**Source:** Eng review, Failure Modes analysis.

### Define PII redaction implementation approach
**What:** Specify the PII redaction mechanism for LangSmith traces (regex-based, NER model, allowlist/denylist, or library like presidio).
**Why:** Section 5 says "redact or hash direct identifiers" but doesn't specify the approach. PII redaction is notoriously error-prone — regex misses edge cases, NER models add latency.
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Harness deployment decisions, LangSmith integration, data volume and latency budget.
**Source:** Eng review, Section 5 (Trace data classification).

## P3 — Nice to Have

### Define Express V2 horizontal scaling story
**What:** Document whether Express V2 on Render runs as single instance, auto-scaled, or behind a load balancer. Define the scaling trigger and expected behavior at 10x tenant count.
**Why:** At 10 tenants × 3 trades, Express V2 handles all webhooks and API requests. Current single-contractor load doesn't require scaling, but the spec positions Express V2 as the product core backend.
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Tenant count growth, Render deployment configuration.
**Source:** CEO review #2, Section 7 (Performance Review).

### Define Cockpit alerting thresholds and channels
**What:** Define specific threshold values for the four alert types (policy gate block rate, worker metric degradation, job failure spikes, external service errors) and the delivery channel (email, SMS, dashboard notification).
**Why:** Sections 3 and 5 say the harness emits alerts to the Cockpit, but without thresholds, alerts are either too noisy or never fire. Thresholds need baseline data from initial deployment.
**Effort:** S
**Depends on:** Harness implementation, baseline metrics from initial deployment.
**Source:** Eng review, Section 3 (Alerting).
